Hi, I'm Aaron Wasserman aka novaah! 

I'm a Senior Offensive Security Engineer at Praetorian helping leading organizations solve complex security problems. I'm a member of the IoT team where I focus on IoT/hardware and web application security assessments. All opinions expressed are my own, not my employer's.

I nuked the old blog I hosted on this domain so that I can publish content more focused on my areas of interest. Expect posts on IoT and hardware hacking with the occasional web/mobile topic thrown in. I am especially interested in fault injection and side-channel attacks at the moment.
